\chapter{ Additional Instructions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item  The number of pages of the final report, excluding front-matter and back-matter (bibliography, appendices) is expected to be about 40. Please consult with the tutor if you want/need to deviate.

\item  You must assume that the knowledge level of the reading audience is that of your peer students.

\item  The page layout of the report including the title page should conform to the TU Delft house styles. Take really good care that the title page contains names, description of course context, affiliation and date as appropriate (do not place your student numbers). Also include a version number, counting the versions submitted to the tutor. (As part of your learning process, the tutor might ask for improvements and resubmission.)

\item  The report should look professional, groomed but not particularly fancy.

\item  Please use quantitative, as opposed to qualitative assessments refer to clear numeric values.

\item  Describe operation and/or performance via equations, not text; all equations that you refer to in the text must be numbered; refer to equations as Eq. (number) or, simply, (number).

\item  Define all symbols/notation once, at the place of first use of that symbol. Make sure that the notation / use of symbols is unambiguous.

\item  Use figures and tables for compact and clear information transfer, refer to those items at least once in the text, and make sure that the graphs have proper axes and labels. This a.o. means that measure units are included. Legends should be included for graphs with multiple curves/plots.

\item  Include numbered captions in pictures and tables; captions are located below figures and above tables; use the relevant numbers for cross-references.
