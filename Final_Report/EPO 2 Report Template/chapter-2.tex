\chapter{General Reporting Requirements}

  

The general requirements on report writing as given for the EE1L11 Booming Bass project will still apply. You may want to consult those guidelines again. In summary:

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Conclusions are verifiable, supported by results (academic approach)

\item  Each report has a clear purpose and scope

\item  All contents contribute to the purpose/scope, no more and no less

\item  A writer is helping the reader to understand the material
\end{enumerate}
