\chapter{Introduction}

  For the EE1L21 Smart Robot Challenge 2021, you have to write a final report which you submit via the assignment folder on Brightspace. The delivered final report should convey to the tutor(s)/assessor(s) of the online oral exam:
the understanding of your group of the various project steps and the final goal,
\begin{enumerate}
\item  the definition of clear (quantifiable) targets,
\item  the reporting, in a scientific way of what was developed, implemented and tested.
\end{enumerate}

Moreover, the process of writing a scientific report is a valuable practice in articulating the theoretical and simulation bases of the work that you have done and/or the material that you are learning. Explaining this in a scientific language to readers as your peers, will provide you an increased understanding of what you did, and will teach you on how to interpret your results. The type of report that you will write for the Smart Robot Challenge is a so-called \textit{Design Report}, see below for what this implies for your writing. In the EE1L21 reporting, you will also pay attention to \textit{citation }and to correct reporting in the face of \textit{measurement accuracy.}

Note that you first submit the draft of your final report to receive feedback from the tutor of your group. Afterwards, you submit your final report which will be evaluated and graded by the jury members /assessors based on the provided rubric during the final oral exams.
