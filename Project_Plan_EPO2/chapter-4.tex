\chapter{Organization $\&$ Schedule  } Make the distribution of workload among group members clear. Create a schedule which gives an overview of activities in relation to time (e.g., duration of each activity, start date, deadlines, etc). Based on these, carefully set your own timeline. Also think about the activities that (critically) influence the project and for which no explicit deadline is given in the manual.
