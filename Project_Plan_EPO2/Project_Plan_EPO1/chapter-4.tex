\chapter{Organization $\&$ Schedule} 
For a group to work as efficiently as possible, there has to be a concrete plan to work toward the end goal. For this project, we have to work in a lot of subgroups with each its own tasks, such as designing their component. In this chapter, we will discuss what and when each group has to complete in order to fulfill the requirements for this project.\\

\section{Plan}
In table \ref{tab:Schedule}:Schedule are all of the tasks described to whom or what subgroup has to do within a certain amount of time, which can deviate, from the corresponding deadline. The plan is applicable to both A1\textunderscore1 and A1\textunderscore2.\\
