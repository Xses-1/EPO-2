# EPO-2

This is a repository for the educational project from the first year of Electrical Engineering Bachelor at TU Delft. </br>

The goal of this project was to design an autonymous robot that can solve a series of challengas in a labirynth. The robot controller was implemented in VHDL and the algorithms that solve the maze were implemented in C and were running on a PC. Communication between the 2 was done using XBee modules and UART.</br>
